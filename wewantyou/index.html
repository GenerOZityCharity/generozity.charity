    <h2 class="display-4" style="text-align: center; color: #1c4587;">You're invited to GenerOZity 10 @ PAX Aus Online! <br>
    </h2>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; color: #1c4587;">
      <br>Hey! Come celebrate our 10th GenerOZity Charity Fundraiser with us at PAX Aus Online! <br>
      <br>GenerOZity is partnering with PAX Aus Online and running for 60 hours, from <b>10:00am on the 8th of October to 10:00pm on the 10th of October.</b>
      <br>&nbsp; <br>This is a formal invite asking if you’d like to come join around 50 other Aussie and New Zealand content creators collaboratively working together to do some good Down Under. <br>
      <br>If you haven’t heard of <u>GenerOZity</u>, we’re an Australian charity that runs a biannual live-stream marathon that brings together streamers, YouTubers, community groups, eSports orgs, and podcasts for one non-stop live broadcast, with all money raised going straight to the charity we’ve chosen for the show. <br>
      <br>We’ve raised a total of <b>$280,889.81</b> dollars to date with $33,185 for Cure Cancer at GenerOZity Slumber Party earlier this year. <br>&nbsp; <br>Our whole team is made up of volunteers working for free. The people that work on the shows. The charity board. Everyone! We’ve never taken a cent to cover costs! <br>
      <br>This show, we’re supporting <u>Cure Cancer</u> as they are an incredible cause that directs funds to researchers with the aim of making us the last generation to ever have anyone die of cancer.

    </h2>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; color: #1c4587;">
      
      <br>The whole show is going to be remote (from home), and that makes it really easy to get involved. <br>&nbsp; <br>1) You say “I am in” <br>2) A member of the team works with you on what you want to stream and what incentives you’d like to put forward <br>3) We give you a time in the schedule <br>4) We send you some assets to use (including a donation widget that you can easily add into OBS / SLOBS / Xsplit) <br>5) When it’s time for your segment, you go live on your own channel as usual and we mirror your feed onto the GenerOZity twitch channel <br>&nbsp; <br>We have a Discord that on the day we use for anyone who has questions / would like a live count-in so they know when they are live. <br>&nbsp; <br>
